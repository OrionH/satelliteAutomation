# Satellite Data Automation

* This script uses location data and the N2YO API to gather weather satellite position information and schedule data downloads as the satellite passes overhead.
* Raw RF data takes up multiple GB of storage space per minute and scheduling download times only when the satellite is overhead reduces the storage requirements considerably.
